    title: Algorithmic Experimental Design
    description: Algorithmic experimental designs. Calculates exact and approximate
      theory experimental designs for D,A, and I criteria. Very large designs may
      be created. Experimental designs may be blocked or blocked designs created from
      a candidate list, using several criteria. The blocking can be done when whole
      and within plot factors interact.

    title: Statistical Procedures for Agricultural Research
    description: Original idea was presented in the thesis "A statistical analysis
      tool for agricultural research" to obtain the degree of Master on science, National
      Engineering University (UNI), Lima-Peru. Some experimental data for the examples
      come from the CIP and others research. Agricolae offers extensive functionality
      on experimental design especially for agricultural and plant breeding experiments,
      which can also be useful for other purposes. It supports planning of lattice,
      Alpha, Cyclic, Complete Block, Latin Square, Graeco-Latin Squares, augmented
      block, factorial, split and strip plot designs. There are also various analysis
      facilities for experimental data, e.g. treatment comparison procedures and several
      non-parametric tests comparison, biodiversity indexes and consensus cluster.

    title: Easy Analysis and Visualization of Factorial Experiments
    description: Facilitates easy analysis of factorial experiments, including purely
      within-Ss designs (a.k.a. "repeated measures"), purely between-Ss designs, and
      mixed within-and-between-Ss designs. The functions in this package aim to provide
      simple, intuitive and consistent specification of data analysis and visualization.
      Visualization functions also include design visualization for pre-analysis data
      auditing, and correlation matrix visualization. Finally, this package includes
      functions for non-parametric analysis, including permutation tests and bootstrap
      resampling. The bootstrap function obtains predictions either by cell means
      or by more advanced/powerful mixed effects models, yielding predictions and
      confidence intervals that may be easily visualized at any level of the experiment's
      design.

    title: Bayesian Optimal INterval (BOIN) Design for Single-Agent and Drug- Combination
      Phase I Clinical Trials
    description: The Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design is a novel phase I clinical
      trial design for finding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). It can be used to
      design both single-agent and drug-combination trials. The BOIN design is motivated
      by the top priority and concern of clinicians when testing a new drug, which
      is to effectively treat patients and minimize the chance of exposing them to
      subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses. The prominent advantage of the BOIN design
      is that it achieves simplicity and superior performance at the same time. The
      BOIN design is algorithm-based and can be implemented in a simple way similar
      to the traditional 3+3 design. The BOIN design yields an average performance
      that is comparable to that of the continual reassessment method (CRM, one of
      the best model-based designs) in terms of selecting the MTD, but has a substantially
      lower risk of assigning patients to subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses. For
      tutorial, please check Yan et al. (2020) <doi:10.18637/jss.v094.i13>.

    title: Nested and Crossed Block Designs for Factorial and Unstructured Treatment
      Sets
    description: Constructs treatment and block designs for linear treatment models
      with crossed or nested block factors. The treatment design can be any feasible
      linear model and the block design can be any feasible combination of crossed
      or nested block factors. The block design is a sum of one or more block factors
      and the block design is optimized sequentially with the levels of each successive
      block factor optimized conditional on all previously optimized block factors.
      D-optimality is used throughout except for square or rectangular lattice block
      designs which are constructed algebraically using mutually orthogonal Latin
      squares. Crossed block designs with interaction effects are optimized using
      a weighting scheme which allows for differential weighting of first and second-order
      block effects. Outputs include a table showing the allocation of treatments
      to blocks and tables showing the achieved D-efficiency factors for each block
      and treatment design. Edmondson, R.N. Multi-level Block Designs for Comparative
      Experiments. JABES 25, 500–522 (2020) <doi:10.1007/s13253-020-00416-0>.

    title: Graphical Analysis of Variance
    description: This small collection of functions provides what we call elemental
      graphics for display of anova results. The term elemental derives from the fact
      that each function is aimed at construction of graphical displays that afford
      direct visualizations of data with respect to the fundamental questions that
      drive the particular anova methods. The two main functions are granova.1w (a
      graphic for one way anova) and granova.2w (a corresponding graphic for two way
      anova). These functions were written to display data for any number of groups,
      regardless of their sizes (however, very large data sets or numbers of groups
      can be problematic). For these two functions a specialized approach is used
      to construct data-based contrast vectors for which anova data are displayed.
      The result is that the graphics use straight lines, and when appropriate flat
      surfaces, to facilitate clear interpretations while being faithful to the standard
      effect tests in anova. The graphic results are complementary to standard summary
      tables for these two basic kinds of analysis of variance; numerical summary
      results of analyses are also provided as side effects. Two additional functions
      are granova.ds (for comparing two dependent samples), and granova.contr (which
      provides graphic displays for a priori contrasts). All functions provide relevant
      numerical results to supplement the graphic displays of anova data. The graphics
      based on these functions should be especially helpful for learning how the methods
      have been applied to answer the question(s) posed. This means they can be particularly
      helpful for students and non-statistician analysts. But these methods should
      be quite generally helpful for work-a-day applications of all kinds, as they
      can help to identify outliers, clusters or patterns, as well as highlight the
      role of non-linear transformations of data. In the case of granova.1w and granova.ds
      especially, several arguments are provided to facilitate flexibility in the
      construction of graphics that accommodate diverse features of data, according
      to their corresponding display requirements. See the help files for individual
      functions.

      that has chisquare efficiency more than user specified efficiency level (mef).
      The package also displays the progress of generation of an efficient multi-level
      k-circulant design through a progress bar. The progress of 100% means that one
      full round of interchange is completed. More than one full round (typically
      4-5 rounds) of interchange may be required for larger designs.

      testing with right censoring or interval censoring. It uses generalized linear
      model (GLM) approach to derive the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of
      regression coefficients. The failure time distribution is assumed to follow
      Weibull distribution with a known shape parameter and log-linear link functions
      are used to model the relationship between failure time parameters and stress
      variables. The acceleration model may have multiple stress factors, although
      most ALTs involve only two or less stress factors. ALTopt package also provides
      several plotting functions including contour plot, Fraction of Use Space (FUS)
      plot and Variance Dispersion graphs of Use Space (VDUS) plot. For more details,

      is escalated based on lack of activity rather than on lack of toxicity and is
      de-escalated only if an unacceptable level of toxicity is experienced.

      used for matching in observational studies with treated and control units, with
      cases and controls, in related settings with instrumental variables, and in
      discontinuity designs. Also, they can be used for the design of randomized experiments,
      for example, for matching before randomization. By default, 'designmatch' uses
      the 'GLPK' optimization solver, but its performance is greatly enhanced by the
      'Gurobi' optimization solver and its associated R interface. For their installation,
      please follow the instructions at <http://user.gurobi.com/download/gurobi-optimizer>

    title: Particle Learning of Gaussian Processes
    description: Sequential Monte Carlo inference for fully Bayesian Gaussian process
      (GP) regression and classification models by particle learning (PL). The sequential
      nature of inference and the active learning (AL) hooks provided facilitate thrifty
      sequential design (by entropy) and optimization (by improvement) for classification
      and regression models, respectively. This package essentially provides a generic
      PL interface, and functions (arguments to the interface) which implement the
      GP models and AL heuristics. Functions for a special, linked, regression/classification
      GP model and an integrated expected conditional improvement (IECI) statistic
      is provides for optimization in the presence of unknown constraints. Separable
      and isotropic Gaussian, and single-index correlation functions are supported.

      efficiency more than user specified efficiency level (mef). The package also
      displays the progress of generation of an efficient mixed-level k-circulant
      design through a progress bar. The progress of 100 per cent means that one full
      round of interchange is completed. More than one full round (typically 4-5 rounds)
      of interchange may be required for larger designs.

    description: The PBIB designs are important type of incomplete block designs having
      wide area of their applications for example in agricultural experiments, in
      plant breeding, in sample surveys etc. This package constructs various series
      of PBIB designs and assists in checking all the necessary conditions of PBIB
      designs and the association scheme on which these designs are based on. It also
      assists in calculating the efficiencies of PBIB designs with any number of associate
      classes. The package also constructs Youden-m square designs which are Row-Column
      designs for the two-way elimination of heterogeneity. The incomplete columns
      of these Youden-m square designs constitute PBIB designs. With the present functionality,
      the package will be of immense importance for the researchers as it will help
      them to construct PBIB designs, to check if their PBIB designs and association
      scheme satisfy various necessary conditions for the existence, to calculate
      the efficiencies of PBIB designs based on any association scheme and to construct
      Youden-m square designs for the two-way elimination of heterogeneity. R. C.

      3+3 designs for comparison or models with non-Bayesian estimation. The whole
      package is written in a modular form in the S4 class system, making it very

      and the sample size calculation method proposed for microarray experiments by
      Liu and Hwang (2007) <DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btl664>. We develop a set of
      functions that calculates appropriate sample sizes for two-sample t-test for
      RNA-seq experiments with fixed or varied set of parameters. The outputs also
      contain a plot of power versus sample size, a table of power at different sample
      sizes, and a table of critical test values at different sample sizes. To install
      this package, please use 'source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R"); biocLite("ssizeRNA")'.
      For R version 3.5 or greater, please use 'if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager",

      sample size recommendations or just the ones they want to see. The calculations
      used to calculate the recommended sample sizes are from the 'pwr' package.

    title: Variance Dispersion Graphs and Fraction of Design Space Plots
    description: Facilities for constructing variance dispersion graphs, fraction-
      of-design-space plots and similar graphics for exploring the properties of experimental
      designs. The design region is explored via random sampling, which allows for
      more flexibility than traditional variance dispersion graphs. A formula interface
      is leveraged to provide access to complex model formulae. Graphics can be constructed
      simultaneously for multiple experimental designs and/or multiple model formulae.
      Instead of using pointwise optimization to find the minimum and maximum scaled
      prediction variance curves, which can be inaccurate and time consuming, this
      package uses quantile regression as an alternative.

    title: Simulation and Group Sequential Monitoring of Randomized Two-Stage Treatment
      Efficacy Trials with Time-to-Event Endpoints
    description: A modification of the preventive vaccine efficacy trial design of
      Gilbert, Grove et al. (2011, Statistical Communications in Infectious Diseases)
      is implemented, with application generally to individual-randomized clinical
      trials with multiple active treatment groups and a shared control group, and
      a study endpoint that is a time-to-event endpoint subject to right-censoring.
      The design accounts for the issues that the efficacy of the treatment/vaccine
      groups may take time to accrue while the multiple treatment administrations/vaccinations
      are given; there is interest in assessing the durability of treatment efficacy
      over time; and group sequential monitoring of each treatment group for potential
      harm, non-efficacy/efficacy futility, and high efficacy is warranted. The design
      divides the trial into two stages of time periods, where each treatment is first
      evaluated for efficacy in the first stage of follow-up, and, if and only if
      it shows significant treatment efficacy in stage one, it is evaluated for longer-term
      durability of efficacy in stage two. The package produces plots and tables describing
      operating characteristics of a specified design including an unconditional power
      for intention-to-treat and per-protocol/as-treated analyses; trial duration;
      probabilities of the different possible trial monitoring outcomes (e.g., stopping
      early for non-efficacy); unconditional power for comparing treatment efficacies;
      and distributions of numbers of endpoint events occurring after the treatments/vaccinations
      are given, useful as input parameters for the design of studies of the association
      of biomarkers with a clinical outcome (surrogate endpoint problem). The code
      can be used for a single active treatment versus control design and for a single-stage
      design.

      Analysis
    description: Produces tables with the level of replication (number of replicates)
      and the experimental uncoded values of the quantitative factors to be used for
      rotatable Central Composite Design (CCD) experimentation and a 2-D contour plot
      of the corresponding variance of the predicted response according to Mead et
      al. (2012) <doi:10.1017/CBO9781139020879> design_ccd(), and analyzes CCD data
      with response surface methodology ccd_analysis(). A rotatable CCD provides values
      of the variance of the predicted response that are concentrically distributed
      around the average treatment combination used in the experimentation, which
      with uniform precision (implied by the use of several replicates at the average
      treatment combination) improves greatly the search and finding of an optimum
      response. These properties of a rotatable CCD represent undeniable advantages
      over the classical factorial design, as discussed by Panneton et al. (1999)
      <doi:10.13031/2013.13267> and Mead et al. (2012) <doi:10.1017/CBO9781139020879.018>

granova,Graphical Analysis of Variance,"This small collection of functions provides what we call elemental graphics for display of anova results. The term elemental derives from the fact that each function is aimed at construction of graphical displays that afford direct visualizations of data with respect to the fundamental questions that drive the particular anova methods. The two main functions are granova.1w (a graphic for one way anova) and granova.2w (a corresponding graphic for two way anova). These functions were written to display data for any number of groups, regardless of their sizes (however, very large data sets or numbers of groups can be problematic). For these two functions a specialized approach is used to construct data-based contrast vectors for which anova data are displayed. The result is that the graphics use straight lines, and when appropriate flat surfaces, to facilitate clear interpretations while being faithful to the standard effect tests in anova. The graphic results are complementary to standard summary tables for these two basic kinds of analysis of variance; numerical summary results of analyses are also provided as side effects. Two additional functions are granova.ds (for comparing two dependent samples), and granova.contr (which provides graphic displays for a priori contrasts). All functions provide relevant numerical results to supplement the graphic displays of anova data. The graphics based on these functions should be especially helpful for learning how the methods have been applied to answer the question(s) posed. This means they can be particularly helpful for students and non-statistician analysts. But these methods should be quite generally helpful for work-a-day applications of all kinds, as they can help to identify outliers, clusters or patterns, as well as highlight the role of non-linear transformations of data. In the case of granova.1w and granova.ds especially, several arguments are provided to facilitate flexibility in the construction of graphics that accommodate diverse features of data, according to their corresponding display requirements.

ODS,Statistical Methods for Outcome-Dependent Sampling Designs,"Outcome-dependent sampling (ODS) schemes are cost-effective ways to enhance study efficiency. In ODS designs, one observes the exposure/covariates with a probability that depends on the outcome variable.

Because ODS data has biased sampling nature, standard statistical analysis such as linear regression will lead to biases estimates of the population parameters. This package implements four statistical methods related to ODS designs: (1) An empirical likelihood method analyzing the primary continuous outcome with respect to exposure variables in continuous ODS design (Zhou et al., 2002). (2) A partial linear model analyzing the primary outcome in continuous ODS design (Zhou, Qin and Longnecker, 2011) <doi: 10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01500.x>.

BayesCTDesign,Two Arm Bayesian Clinical Trial Design with and Without Historical Control Data,"A set of functions to help clinical trial researchers calculate power and sample size for two-arm Bayesian randomized clinical trials that do or do not incorporate historical control data. At some point during the design process, a clinical trial researcher who is designing a basic two-arm Bayesian randomized clinical trial needs to make decisions about power and sample size within the context of hypothesized treatment effects. Through simulation, the simple_sim() function will estimate power and other user specified clinical trial characteristics at user specified sample sizes given user defined scenarios about treatment effect,control group characteristics, and outcome. If the clinical trial researcher has access to historical control data, then the researcher can design a two-arm Bayesian randomized clinical trial that incorporates the historical data. In such a case, the researcher needs to work through the potential consequences of historical and randomized control differences on trial characteristics, in addition to working through issues regarding power in the context of sample size, treatment effect size, and outcome. If a researcher designs a clinical trial that will incorporate historical control data, the researcher needs the randomized controls to be from the same population as the historical controls. What if this is not the case when the designed trial is implemented? During the design phase, the researcher needs to investigate the negative effects of possible historic/randomized control differences on power, type one error, and other trial characteristics. Using this information, the researcher should design the trial to mitigate these negative effects. Through simulation, the historic_sim() function will estimate power and other user specified clinical trial characteristics at user specified sample sizes given user defined scenarios about historical and randomized control differences as well as treatment effects and outcomes. The results from historic_sim() and simple_sim() can be printed with print_table() and graphed with plot_table() methods.

The BOIN design is motivated by the top priority and concern of clinicians when testing a new drug, which is to effectively treat patients and minimize the chance of exposing them to subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses. The prominent advantage of the BOIN design is that it achieves simplicity and superior performance at the same time. The BOIN design is algorithm-based and can be implemented in a simple way similar to the traditional 3+3 design. The BOIN design yields an average performance that is comparable to that of the continual reassessment method (CRM, one of the best model-based designs) in terms of selecting the MTD, but has a substantially lower risk of assigning patients to subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses.

From this discussion will come a statistical plan for a (non-randomized) validation trial. Both prospective and retrospective trials are supported. In a specific focused discussion, investigators should determine the range of ""discomfort"" for the NNT, number needed to treat. The meaning of the discomfort range, [NNTlower, NNTupper], is that within this range most physicians would feel discomfort either in treating or withholding treatment. A pair of NNT values bracketing that range, NNTpos and NNTneg, become the targets of the study's design. If the trial can demonstrate that a positive biomarker test yields an NNT less than NNTlower, and that a negative biomarker test yields an NNT less than NNTlower, then the biomarker may be useful for patients.

The design accounts for the issues that the efficacy of the treatment/vaccine groups may take time to accrue while the multiple treatment administrations/vaccinations are given; there is interest in assessing the durability of treatment efficacy over time; and group sequential monitoring of each treatment group for potential harm, non-efficacy/efficacy futility, and high efficacy is warranted. The design divides the trial into two stages of time periods, where each treatment is first evaluated for efficacy in the first stage of follow-up, and, if and only if it shows significant treatment efficacy in stage one, it is evaluated for longer-term durability of efficacy in stage two. The package produces plots and tables describing operating characteristics of a specified design including an unconditional power for intention-to-treat and per-protocol/as-treated analyses; trial duration; probabilities of the different possible trial monitoring outcomes (e.g., stopping early for non-efficacy); unconditional power for comparing treatment efficacies; and distributions of numbers of endpoint events occurring after the treatments/vaccinations are given, useful as input parameters for the design of studies of the association of biomarkers with a clinical outcome (surrogate endpoint problem).
